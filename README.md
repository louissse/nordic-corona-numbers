# nordic-corona-numbers
Initially a project made to try a basic setup with npm and webpack for a web-project.

As this was during the Corona crisis of 2020 it developed into a project with a chart for deaths caused by Covid-19 in some of the nordic 
countries. As of march 3rd the numbers are no longer updated.
