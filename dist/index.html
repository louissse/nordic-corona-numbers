          <p>This chart shows the total number of deaths for each country every day. To compare the development of the virus, day zero is the day each country had the first death. For each country a line is drawn representing an exponential model for the last 7 days. The model tells how many days it takes for the total number of deaths to double. When seen on a log scale the model will be a straight line. This line makes it possible to see if the curve for the general data is flattening. If this is the case, the general data will be a curve with previous data lying below the straight model line.</p>
